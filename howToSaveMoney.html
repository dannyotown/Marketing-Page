        <h1>How To: Save Money</h1>
        <p>Are you looking for an easy way to begin? On the first day of a new month, get a receipt for everything you
          purchase. Stack the receipts into categories like restaurants, groceries, and personal care. At the end of the
          month you will be able to clearly see where your money is going.</p>
        <h2>Money Advice</h2>
        <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Budget with cash and envelopes. </span> If you have trouble with overspending, try the envelope budget system where
          you use a set amount of cash for most spending. And once the cash is gone, it's gone</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Aim for short-term savings goals. </span> Make a goal such as setting aside $20 a week or month, rather than a longer
          term savings goal. People save more successfully when they keep short-term goals in sight.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Take full advantage of employer matches to your retirement plan. </span>Often as an incentive, employers will match
          a certain amount of what you save in a retirement plan such as a 401(k). If you don't take full advantage of
          this match, you're leaving money on the table. </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Use the 24 hour rule. </span>This rules helps avoid purchasing expensive or unnecessary items on impulse. Think over each nonessential purchase for at least 24 hours. This is particularly easy to do while shopping online, because you can add items to your cart or wish list and come back to them a day later.  </p>
